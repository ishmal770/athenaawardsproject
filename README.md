# athenaawardsproject
Repo created for Athena Awards 

My project is a physics bot, that helps kids with their physics problems. It has a chatbot, freebody diagram generator, learning resources, and a quiz section! 






Please combine my hours from USACOpracticefolder.py and ATHENAPHYSICS.py in Hackatime
